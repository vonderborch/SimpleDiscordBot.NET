# SimpleDiscordBot.NET
A simple framework for rapidly creating simple command-driven Discord bots. Uses [Discord.Net](https://discordnet.dev/index.html) underneath, 

# Installation
A nuget package is available: [SimpleDiscordBot.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SimpleDiscordBot.NET/)

# Why?
While working with Discord.Net to get a simple bot up and running, I decided to try setting up my own framework built on top of their library to make getting simple command-driven bots up and running a little quicker.

# Example
My [RandomizerBot](https://github.com/vonderborch/RandomizerBot) Discord bot uses this framework and can be used as an example of how things work.
